                TesSeRact Printer Control System

      The TesSeRact Printer Control System lets you design
      your program's output without regard to what printer
      is physically connected to the end-user's computer.
      Complete support is included for long printer escape
      codes (such as those needed for laser printers), and
      the system provides support for centering, 
      justification, bolds and underlines.
